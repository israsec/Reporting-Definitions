Username enumeration is a common application vulnerability which occurs when an attacker can determine if usernames are valid or not. Most commonly, this issue occurs on login forms, where an error similar to “the username is invalid” is returned.

An attacker can exploit this behavior by using lengthy lists of common usernames, known names, and dictionary words to observe the application response to the input. Depending on the error message that the application provides the attacker may be able to infer which usernames are valid and target those users with phishing or a password spray attack.
