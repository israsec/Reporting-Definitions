Username enumeration is a common application vulnerability which occurs when an attacker can determine if usernames are valid or not. Most commonly, this issue occurs on login forms, where an error similar to “the username is invalid” is returned.

An attacker can exploit this behavior by using lengthy lists of common usernames, known names, and dictionary words to observe the application response to all. With those results, the attacker can then infer which usernames are valid.
