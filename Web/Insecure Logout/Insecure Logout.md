The logout functionality in not handled in a secure way. When a user authenticates to the web application a unique auth token/cookie is created. This token is what identifies the user to the application. When a user logs out of the application it is expected that the user's session is invalidated and the cookie is destroyed. However we found that this was not the case and that even after user logout, the cookie is still valid for an extended period of time.
