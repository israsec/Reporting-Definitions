We recommend:

•	Restrict access to all administrative login panels to only trusted IP adresses via a firewall. If this is not possible then at least change the path from /admin to something like /this/is/hard/to/find/nothing/here/admin

•	(MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE) Configure brute force prevention. For cPanel the tool is called cPHulk and can be seen here: https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/security-center/cphulk-brute-force-protection/

•	Enable Multi Factor Authentication on all administrative panels.
