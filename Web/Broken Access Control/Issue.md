Broken Acccess control is a broad security vulnerability that may allow a user to view or perform unauthorized activities in the target site. Essentially Broken Access control is the failure to properly ensure that a user is authorized to do what it is that they are doing. This can also include exposing sensitive pages to all users without any authentication needed at all.

Common access control vulnerabilities include:

* Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct object references).

* Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.

* Forced browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user.
