This vulnerability is created because of underlying authorization flaws. The individual endpoints do not validate the authorization token of the user before being processed by the API. This is the flaw that allows one user to read and/or edit the data belonging to a different user. It is recommended to fine tune the way the application handles Authorization to ensure that only authorized users are allowed access to specific data.

For a great guide that explains the proper way to implement Authorization and the various methods (RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC) please see the following: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html
