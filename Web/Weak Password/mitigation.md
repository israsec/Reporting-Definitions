The password policy should contain the following complexity rules:  
•	Passwords should contain at least eight characters. Twelve characters are recommended for highly-sensitive applications.   
•	Each password should contain three different types of characters. It is recommended to use: symbols, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and digits.   
•	The password policy should be enforced during password selection or alteration.  
•	Not allow setting a password that contains guessable and simple patterns such as: Username, Password1, Aa1234565.

Optional recommendations that would further enhance the strength of the password policy include:      
•	Providing the user with a visual indicator when they are creating passwords that illustrates password complexity and strength.
