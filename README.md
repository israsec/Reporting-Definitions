# Reporting Definitions
This is intended to function as a encylopedia for vulnerabilites, their descriptions and their mitigations.

The structure will be divided into **Web**, **Infrastructure** and **Mobile** folders.

Each folder will have subfolders titled with the name of the vulnerability (for example **CSRF**).

Then there will be entries for **Definition** and for **Mitigation**. Additionally, there can be a **Notes** file which contains more information about a vulnerability. (For example that its only a vulerability if certain condidtions are met, or why this vulnerabilty is really not a vulnerability etc)
